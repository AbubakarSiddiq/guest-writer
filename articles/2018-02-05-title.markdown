**TL;DR:** Briefly describe what this article is about and what the reader will achieve/learn after reading it. Please,
also provide the link to a GitHub repository that contains code related to this article.

Usually, we start describing again what this article is about. The difference, however, is that here we can explain with
more words. Another important thing that we should include in this first paragraph are the name of the main technologies

[SPA (Single Page Application)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).
