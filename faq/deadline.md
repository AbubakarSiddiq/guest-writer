## Is There a Deadline?

The short answer is: No, the process duration depends on how busy or free is the Guest Author during the process.

To provide a better explanation:

Guest Authors usually manage to produce an article within a month. I would say that the average time is less than **three weeks**. However, we know that Guest Authors do have other duties and that they can get stuck with other important matters. Therefore, it **wouldn't be a problem** if you take around **eight to ten weeks** to produce the article. Taking longer than that wouldn't be a problem either, the only thing is that we might end up with an article that is not relevant anymore.
