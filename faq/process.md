## The Process of Writing to Auth0

Usually, these are the steps that take place in the Guest Author Program (i.e. after candidate evaluation):

```
1 - The (Guest Author) GA develops a prototype with the chosen technologies and upload it to a GitHub repo with basic instructions on how to run.
2 - Editors analyse the prototype, the code, and the idea to provide feedback.
3 - The GA applies (if needed) any fix/enhancement asked by the editors.
4 - The GA develops an outline of the article (just the main structure with headers and sub-headers, no content is produced in this step).
5 - Editors analyse and make comments on the outline.
6 - The GA applies (if needed) corrections to the outline.
7 - The GA writes the post.
8 - Editors review the post and, if needed, make corrections, amendments, etc.
```
