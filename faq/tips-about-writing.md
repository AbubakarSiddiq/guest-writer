## Tips About Writing to Auth0

### Grammatical Person

Choose one grammatical person and stick with it. Usually, writers tend to stick with "we" (first-person plural) when writing articles. For example:

- "Now, we have to create a new file...";
- "Let's use this nice package to help us ...";

### Punctuation

Writers usually forget to give the proper attention to punctuation. Punctuation helps readers to understand what the author is trying to say. So, please, **do use** commas, full stops, colons, parentheses, and so on where appropriate. Not using punctuation generally leads to [run-on sentences](http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/runons.htm) that are hard to understand.

### Capitalization

Please, capitalize the words appropriately. There are two cases where you need to capitalize:

1. when starting new sentences;
2. when referring to proper nouns.

For example, _GitHub_ has two uppercase letters. So, it's important not to write _Github_ nor _github_. _JavaScript_ is another similar example. It is not _Javascript_ nor _javascript_.

**Note that** these are just two examples. Please, search how a proper noun is written and follow the convention.

### Capitalization

Learn the different types of formatting on Markdown files and use them. Take special care when adding blocks of code. The following cheatsheets can help you learn how to format your article:
