## Tips About Writing to Auth0

### Originality

Guest Authors have to produce **original articles**. That is, the content has be written with the authors' words and **no plagiarism will be accepted**. It is normal and totally ok to use and quote external references. Actually, this is desired, as it makes the article more reliable from an SEO perspective (articles will rank better when linking trustworthy sources of information).

However, authors have to study, learn, and understand the technologies involved to a point where they can explain these topics with their own words. Authors also have to strive to produce explanations better than those found on the web. This is what it makes an article valuable.

### Grammatical Person

Choose one grammatical person and stick with it. Usually, writers tend to stick with "we" (first-person plural) when writing articles. For example:

- "Now, we have to create a new file...";
- "Let's use this nice package to help us ...";

### Punctuation

Writers usually forget to give the proper attention to punctuation. Punctuation helps readers to understand what the author is trying to say. So, please, **do use** commas, full stops, colons, parentheses, and so on where appropriate. Not using punctuation generally leads to [run-on sentences](http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/runons.htm) that are hard to understand.

### Capitalization

Please, capitalize the words appropriately. There are two cases where you need to capitalize:

1. when starting new sentences;
2. when referring to proper nouns.

For example, _GitHub_ has two uppercase letters. So, it's important not to write _Github_ nor _github_. _JavaScript_ is another similar example. It is not _Javascript_ nor _javascript_.

**Note that** these are just two examples. Please, search how a proper noun is written and follow the convention.
