## Auth0 Blog for Guest Writers

Actually, as this makes the process of starting a new article so easy, it will probably be used by all writers in a few
weeks.

Anyway, for the moment, there are two commands available. The first one asks a few questions and then generates a new
article. The second one, which depends on Docker being installed and the `docker` command being available, starts the
blog engine.

```bash
# create a new post
node src/

# launch blog engine
node docker/
```
